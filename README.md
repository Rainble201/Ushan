There are 64 types of dense layer structures in this test. (But in the following introduction, 
2 blocks are used and each block contains 6 dense layers as an example.)
In the architecture outlined by the following flowchart , each block consists of 6 dense layers,and each dense layer has 90 nodes ,
these two structures can be combined and perform an efficient experiment.
The blocks are interconnected in a specific way: the input to a current block is derived from the output of its preceding block. 
Additionally, the output from the current block is summed with the input from the preceding block before progressing to the next stage. 
This results in a connection scheme that differs from the standard, sequential layering found in more conventional models.
